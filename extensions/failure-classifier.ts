/**
 * Failure classification for subagent runs.
 *
 * Distinguishes *technical* failures (LLM provider errors, process crashes,
 * infrastructure problems) from *agent-level* outcomes (the agent completed
 * its turn, but its own work contains errors — e.g. it ran tests and the
 * tests failed, or it wrote code with a bug). Only technical failures should
 * ever cause a workflow to auto-abort; agent-level "failures" are just part
 * of the agent's normal output and the workflow should keep going.
 *
 * Reuses the retryable-model-failure pattern list from model-fallback.ts as
 * a base (same signal: "this smells like infrastructure, not agent work"),
 * but is evaluated at a different point for a different purpose — not
 * "should I retry this same model" but "should the whole workflow stop".
