/**
 * Graph executor — walks a graph in topological rounds (supersteps), with AND
 * fan-in readiness and wave reset on back-edges.
 *
 * There is one execution model. A graph whose nodes each have a single
 * outgoing edge walks one node per round, which is an ordinary sequential
 * walk; a node with several outgoing edges fans out and its branches run
 * concurrently in the same round. Fan-out is a property of the graph, not a
 * separate mode.
 *
 * Model (see docs/PARALLEL-OPTIONA-GAP-ANALYSIS.md, Decisions 5 & 6):
 *
 *   frontier = { entry }
 *   while frontier not empty:
 *     round += 1                          # maxIterations counts ROUNDS
 *     outcomes = await Promise.all(frontier.map(runNode))   # barrier isolation
 *     for each outcome: state[id] = result                # each under its own id
 *     frontier = computeNextFrontier(fired edges)         # in-degree + wave reset
 *
 * Readiness is AND fan-in: a node runs only when ALL its incoming edges'
 * sources have fired toward it. A fan-in node never sees partial data.
 *
 * Wave reset on a back-edge: when an edge fires at a node that already ran
 * (a cycle / escalation), the subgraph downstream of that target is reset —
 * every node there returns to its static in-degree and is forgotten as
 * executed — so the next wave restarts cleanly from the target. Siblings in
 * that subgraph re-run; pi-session resume makes those re-runs cheap.
 *
 * Claims are tracked PER SOURCE, not as one flat counter (see
 * `computeStaticClaims` / `PendingClaims`). A reset restores only the claims
 * whose source is itself inside the reset subgraph — those sources will
 * re-run and re-release. Claims from sources outside the reset subgraph keep
 * whatever state they already had (released or still pending): that source
 * already ran (or hasn't yet) and a reset elsewhere does not change that.
 * Flattening claims to one number per node — the original design — loses
 * exactly this distinction and re-armed already-released claims whenever two
 * back-edges resolved in different rounds, deadlocking a fan-in that should
 * have completed. See docs/PARALLEL-OPTIONA-GAP-ANALYSIS.md.
 *
 * Two counters: `iterations` (rounds) feeds the safety cap; `nodeExecutions`
 * (nodes run) feeds display and budget. They were identical in the linear
 * executor but diverge here because a round can run N nodes.
