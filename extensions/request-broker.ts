/**
 * The request broker.
 *
 * Every request for judgement — whether from a `human()` node in-process or an
 * `ask_user_question` / `ask_supervisor` tool call from a child process — passes
 * through here. The broker owns the queue, the coalescing window, and the
 * expiry rules; the transports (in-process direct call, filesystem polling)
 * and the sinks (the user's TUI, the main agent's conversation) are adapters.
 *
 * The design has three asymmetries, all deliberate:
 *
 * 1. Human requests never expire; supervisor requests do (10 min).
 *    The user is watching the run and a countdown that silently picks a
 *    default while they're reading the question is hostile. The supervisor
 *    (the main agent) may answer in prose without calling the reply tool, and
 *    nobody is watching a child wait on it.
 *
 * 2. Coalescing batches near-simultaneous asks, not distant ones.
 *    A fan-out where several agents ask at once collapses into one tabbed
 *    dialog. An agent asking 30 seconds later still queues, because batching
 *    it would hold the first asker hostage for an answer that may never come.
 *
 * 3. Cancellation is per-request, not per-batch.
 *    If the user dismisses a dialog or a run aborts, only that request is
 *    cancelled; the rest of the queue is untouched.
