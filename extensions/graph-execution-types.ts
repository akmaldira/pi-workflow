/**
 * Shared vocabulary for graph execution.
 *
 * The graph is walked by the superstep executor in `graph-superstep-executor.ts`;
 * this module holds the types and helpers both it and its callers speak —
 * what a node execution looks like, how a node is run, and how a run ends.
 *
 * There is one execution model. A node produces a result, the result lands in
 * shared state under the node's own id, and edges decide where work goes next.
 * When an implementer reports a blocker, an edge routes back to whoever owns
 * the contract and that agent sees the blocker in the state it receives — no
 * message bus, no dispatcher, no coordination tools inside the agents.
