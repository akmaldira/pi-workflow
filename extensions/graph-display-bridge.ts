 * nodes, so the mapping is:
 *
 *   graph run       -> run
 *   node execution  -> agent entry (one per visit, so loops stay visible)
 *   node id         -> label
 *
 * Phases are left empty. A graph has no linear phase structure, and
 * inventing one would misrepresent a cyclic walk as a pipeline.
